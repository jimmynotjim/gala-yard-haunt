"""
Button input example for Raspberry Pi.

This example demonstrates reading a button press and controlling an LED.
Press the button to toggle the LED on/off.

Wiring:
- Button: One side -> GPIO 23, other side -> Ground
- LED positive (long leg) -> GPIO 17
- LED negative (short leg) -> 330Î© resistor -> Ground

Note: The button uses internal pull-up resistor, so it reads HIGH when not pressed
and LOW when pressed.
